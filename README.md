# Basic-Calculator
This is a simple, fully functional calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features
Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Clear the current input.
Calculate the result and display it on the screen.
Simple and responsive user interface.
How to Use the Calculator
1. Opening the Calculator
After downloading the project files, locate the index.html file.
Open the Basic Calculator.html file in any web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) by double-clicking on it.
2. Using the Calculator Interface
The calculator has a straightforward layout, consisting of:

Input Display: The top text field where the numbers and operators are shown.
Buttons: A grid of buttons for digits (0-9), decimal point (.), and arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /). There is also a button for clearing the input (C) and calculating the result (=).
3. Performing Calculations
Step 1: Click on the number buttons (0–9) to input numbers into the display.
Step 2: Click on any arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /) to select the operation you want to perform.
Step 3: Continue adding numbers or operators as needed to form a valid expression (e.g., 5 + 3 * 2).
Step 4: Press the = button to calculate the result and display it on the screen.
Step 5: To clear the current input and start fresh, click the C button.

4. Error Handling
If an invalid expression is entered (e.g., multiple operators in a row), the calculator will display "Error."
To fix the error, simply clear the input by pressing the C button and re-enter a valid expression.
6. Examples
Example 1: To calculate 3 + 2, press:
3 → + → 2 → = (Result: 5)
Example 2: To calculate 8 / 4, press:
8 → / → 4 → = (Result: 2)
Example 3: To calculate 9 * 5, press:
9 → * → 5 → = (Result: 45)
Example 4: To calculate 7 - 2, press:
7 → - → 2 → = (Result: 5)

File Structure

The project consists of three main files:

Basic Calculator.html: Contains the HTML structure for the calculator.
styles.css: Contains the CSS styling to make the calculator visually appealing and responsive.
index.js: Contains the JavaScript code that powers the functionality of the calculator.

Customization

If you'd like to modify or customize the calculator, you can:
Change the styling: Modify the styles.css file to adjust colors, layout, or fonts.
Add more features: Extend the functionality in index.js by adding more advanced operations (e.g., square root, exponentiation).
Improve user interface: Modify the HTML structure in Basic Calculator.html for any additional features or improvements you want.

Troubleshooting

The calculator shows "Error": This means the input expression is invalid (e.g., incomplete operation, multiple consecutive operators). Press C to clear the display and try again.
Buttons are not responsive: Ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your browser.
